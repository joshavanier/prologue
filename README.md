**Prologue** is an Obsidian plugin that replaces the new tab page with one that shows a random selection from a designated repository of quotes, reminders, facts, or notes&mdash;of things you want to remind yourself of every now and then.

## installation

This plugin is yet to be published. To try it now, clone this repo into your vault's directory, under `./.obsidian/plugins`

## setup

You'll need to create a note titled *collection*. You may customise this to your liking in the plugin settings tab.

In your *collection*, add your notes where each item is separated by a blank line. For example:

```markdown

> Slowness is beauty &mdash; Auguste Rodin

Drink water.

The Three Gates of Speech:
1. Is it true?
2. Is it necessary?
3. Is it kind?
