Hello. Don't forget to update [[collection.md]]; add notes, quotes, or reminders, separated by one or more blank lines in between.

Add some quotes in [[collection.md]]. Markdown syntax is supported, like so:
> Slowness is beauty.
> &mdash;Auguste Rodin


If you prefer a different file to [[collection.md]], you may specify your own in the settings.
